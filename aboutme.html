      <h2>About Me Section</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Henry. My full name is Henry Vinh Tran, with my middle name coming from my Vietnamese heritage. <strong>Vinh</strong> means glory and, in conjunction with my brother's middle name, means <strong>victory</strong>; a way of my parents' advice to <em>stick together and trust family</em>. <strong>Tran</strong> is a Chinese surname—my father is Chinese—and the story goes that a government servant of the Tran emperor was bestowed the honor of the surname to his future descendants.</p>

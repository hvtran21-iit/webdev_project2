		<h1>MARMOTS: FUN FACTS AND OTHER TRIVIA</h1> <!--I actually tried making this webpage for a Shark Tank project back in middle school. Since it was a solo project, I gave up halfway and as a result only stuck with basic paragraphs and a photo after a long time of stressing about it. Fun times!-->

	  <h3>QUICK FUN FACTS</h3>
	  <ul>
			<li>Marmots are related to squirrels we see in our backyards. In fact, they are classified as ground squirrels. Yes, that makes a groundhog a marmot and by definition a ground squirrel.</li>
			<li>Marmots' diet are mostly grass and other vegetation, which isn't nutrititous. That makes them vegetarian (and very hungry ones at that).</li>
			<li>Marmots primarily live in the Northern Hemisphere--US, Canada, Mexico--but can also be found in Central Europe and Asia.</li>

    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
    <p>While some marmot species are abundant, others face threats due to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitats and ensure their survival.</p>
    <h3>Interesting Tidbits</h3>

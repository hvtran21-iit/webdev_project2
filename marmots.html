	  <h3>QUICK FUN FACTS</h3>
	  <ul>
			<li>Marmots are related to squirrels we see in our backyards. In fact, they are classified as ground squirrels. Yes, that makes a groundhog a marmot and by definition a ground squirrel.</li>
			<li>Marmots' diet are mostly grass and other vegetation, which isn't nutrititous. That makes them vegetarian (and very hungry ones at that).</li>
			<li>Marmots primarily live in the Northern Hemisphere--US, Canada, Mexico--but can also be found in Central Europe and Asia.</li>

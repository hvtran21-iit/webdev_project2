      <h3>QUICK FUN FACTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Marmots are related to squirrels we see in our backyards. In fact, they are classified as ground squirrels. Yes, that makes a groundhog a marmot and by definition a ground squirrel.</li>
        <li>Marmots' diet consists mostly of grass and other vegetation, which isn't very nutritious. That makes them vegetarian (and very hungry ones at that).</li>
        <li>Marmots primarily live in the Northern Hemisphere—US, Canada, Mexico—but can also be found in Central Europe and Asia.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Habitat and Behavior</h3>
      <p>Marmots typically inhabit mountainous areas and prefer open grassy regions where they can burrow. They are known for their social behavior and often live in colonies.</p>
      <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
      <p>While some marmot species are abundant, others face threats due to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitats and ensure their survival.</p>
      <h3>Interesting Tidbits</h3>
      <p>Marmots are known for their whistle-like calls, which they use to communicate with each other. During summer, they are active and can often be seen sunbathing or foraging for food.</p>
